# Swift Compiler Error: Missing Argument Label

This repository demonstrates a common Swift compiler error related to missing argument labels when calling functions with named parameters.  The `bug.swift` file showcases the incorrect usage that triggers the error, while `bugSolution.swift` provides the corrected code.

**Problem:**

In Swift, functions can have named parameters.  If you omit the argument label when calling the function, the compiler will generate an error.

**Solution:**

Ensure that you always include the argument label when calling functions with named parameters.
